0,n,Neutron,0,0,0,"An atomic nucleus, or a [em1]nuclide[em1], is made of [em2]protons[em2] and [em3]neutrons[em3]. Protons have a positive charge to[br]counteract the negative charge of [em2]electrons[em2] that orbit in shells around the nucleus. Neutrons have [em3]zero[em3][br][em3]charge[em3]; that is to say they are neutral.[br] [br]More neutrons in a nucleus do not change an element's chemical properties but they do make it [em1]heavier[em1] and[br]they can affect how [em2]stable[em2] the nuclide is. Nuclides that are not stable [em2]decay[em2] into other nuclides. The measure[br]for how long a given nuclide will last is called its [em3]half-life[em3]. Nuclides decay [em1]at random[em1] so it's impossible to know[br]exactly when a particular nuclide will decay. Instead, how long it takes about half of a bunch of the same[br]nuclide to decay is measurable, and that's what half-life means.[br] [br]The nuclide that is a lone free neutron, [link]Neutron-1[link], has a half-life of about 10 minutes. This means if you[br]had 1000 free neutrons then after ten minutes you could expect to have only 500, and only 250 left after[br]20 minutes. Neutrons are stable when combined with one or more protons to form an [em1]atomic nucleus[em1]."
1,H,Hydrogen,1,1,1,"As the very first element [em3]Hydrogen[em3] has only one proton. It's not just first on the Periodic Table, though, it's[br]literally [em1]the first element to exist[em1]. To this day [em2]75% of all the matter in the universe is Hydrogen[em2].[br] [br]Hydrogen on its own is usually a [em1]gas[em1]. The two H's in [em3]H[sub]2[sub]0[em3] are the two Hydrogen atoms, combined with one[br]Oxygen atom, to make [em2]water[em2]. In many common reactions between [em1]acids (like vinegar - C[sub]2[sub]H[sub]4[sub]O[sub]2[sub])[em1] and [em2]bases[em2][br][em2](like baking soda - NaHCO[sub]3[sub])[em2], the acid gives a Hydrogen to the base.[br] [br]Hydrogen has two stable isotopes: [link]Hydrogen-1[link] with zero neutrons, also called [em3]Protium[em3], and [link]Hydrogen-2[link] with[br]one neutron, also called [em3]Deuterium[em3] (remember: the number comes from the sum of neutrons and protons).[br]With two neutrons, [link]Hydrogen-3[link] also has a special name: [em3]Tritium[em3]. Tritium has a [em1]half life[em1] of 12.32 years,[br]making it the most stable [em1]radioisotope[em1] of Hydrogen (isotopes that are [em2]radioactive[em2] and decay). All the other[br]isotopes of Hydrogen are very unstable and have half-lives that are only fractions of a second."
